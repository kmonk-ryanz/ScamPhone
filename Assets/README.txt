ScamBooth

ScamBooth is a simple VR experience where you appear in a eerie, nocturnal oceanside setting where you hear muffled phone calls from the only object in the area: an old phonebooth. You nervously anticipate any creepy or horror voices/noises but that vanished when you hear about your car's extended warranty, truly more horrifying than any creepy voice. 

Instructions:

Use the left joystick to move and use the grip button to grab the phone and listen to it.
